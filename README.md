## Summary

**MATES 2D** is a top-down 2D mystery game set in the Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science (MATES). Built with Unity 6, the game guides players through an interactive adventure filled with classes, clubs, and quirky characters from the MATES environment. Players solve mysteries and complete quests via mini-games and narrative events inspired by real-life experiences at the school.

##  The Why

We created MATES 2D as a love letter to our school and a commemoration of our time here. As MATES enters a new chapter in the coming years, we aimed to preserve it as we remember it- The Golden Age

## Tech Used

- **Engine:** Unity 6000.0.38.f1 (2D Core)
- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Dialogue Scripting:** Ink (integrated into Unity)
- **Tileset:** Modern Interiors ($3.00)
- **Sprite & Pixel Art Tools:** Aseprite, GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)

---

## 🗺️ Features & Functionality

- ✅ Player movement in 8 directions
- ✅ Scene transitions and interactable environments
- ✅ NPCs with dynamic dialogue
- ✅ Core quest system
- ✅ Saving, loading, and settings menu
- ✅ MATES-inspired world map and custom sprites

**Declan Best**

## Challenges & Scope Adjustment

While we initially envisioned a full-length, story-driven mystery adventure with branching narratives, endings, and cutscenes, time and experience constraints led us to scale down. We focused on delivering a playable demo featuring core functionality and a stylized version of MATES that still captured its essence.

---

## Future Development Plans

If we had more time, the next steps would include:

- Expanding the map to fully represent MATES
- Adding more detailed NPCs (teachers, students)
- Designing full quest lines and mini-games
- Creating cutscenes and alternate endings
- Enhancing visual polish and adding original soundtracks

---

## Final Thoughts

Though we didn’t reach a fully publishable product, **MATES 2D** is a creative tribute to our time at MATES and we are proud of what we have done.
